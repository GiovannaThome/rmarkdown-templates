# RMarkdown Templates

This repository contains a collection of personal [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) templates. The article, letter, and title page templates use [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/) and [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) fonts, British English spelling, coloured links, double spacing, back references, and numbered sections. Also, the article template already includes all packages required by [kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra); it should work out of the box. I plan to include templates for CVs, xaringan and beamer presentations, and academic posters soon. 

Each folder contains a file with the pdf output of each template, check them out to see how the templates look like. Comments and suggestions are most welcome.

To compile the pdfs, you need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (and the [rmarkdown package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown)), [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), and a [TeX system](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
