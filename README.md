# RMarkdown Templates

This repository contains a collection of personal [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) templates. They have a similar style and use [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/) and [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) fonts, British English spelling, coloured links, double spacing, back references, and numbered sections. Also, the article template already includes all packages required by [kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra); it should work out of the box. I plan to include templates for CVs, presentations, and academic posters soon. 

Each folder contains a pdf with the output of the template. Check them out to see how the documents look like. Comments and suggestions are most welcome.

To compile the pdfs, you need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (and the [rmarkdown package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown)), [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), and a [TeX system](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
